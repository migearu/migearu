# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Miguel Aruelo, I'm currently a high school junior, and I do a few things in my life.<br>
I'm interested in computer science, especially stuff like algorithms, cryptography, etc.<br>
Other than that, my other interests are electronics, music production, chemistry, mathematics, etc.

# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- An RPG bullet hell game in Unreal Engine 5.
- An implementation of Elliptic Curve cryptography, using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in C++

# ðŸ¤” What I've finished ...
- A 3D renderer built entirely using the CMU graphics library
  - I had to learn and implement a lot of things from computer graphics, especially linear algebra.
- Quick and dirty implementation of the RSA algorithm in Python
- A multiband distortion plugin made in Rust with NIH-Plug
  - Here, I gained a great deal of understanding when it came to digital signal processing, and the ideas behind many of the plugins I use in my music.
  - Also helped a great deal with my sense of algorithms.

# ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- Unreal Engine 5, along with C++
- Elliptic Curves and Finite Fields

# âš¡ Achievements ...
- 60/75 in the 2023 Waterloo Canadian Computing Competition (Junior Division)
- 61/75 in the 2024 Waterloo Canadian Computing Competition (Junior Division)

# ðŸ˜„ Outside of programming, I ...
- Make music under an alias: https://www.youtube.com/@sevenlivesmusic
- Do a slight bit of 3D modelling (I'm not good at it though).
