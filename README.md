# Hi there 👋
My name is Miguel Aruelo, I'm currently an Honours Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo, and I do a few things in my life.<br>
I'm interested in computer science, especially stuff like algorithms, cryptography, etc.<br>
Other than that, my other interests are electronics, music production, chemistry, mathematics, etc.

# ⚡ My Skillset
- I am proficient in Python, C# (Unity), and JavaScript.
- I also know C, C++, Rust, Lua, Java, and TypeScript to varying skill levels.
- I can work with embedded systems, specifically the Arduino, and STM32 platforms.
- Currently, I'm learning Haskell.

# 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- Nothing major yet!

# 🤔 What I've finished ...
- A 3D renderer built entirely using the CMU graphics library
  - I had to learn and implement a lot of things from computer graphics, especially some concepts from linear algebra.
- Quick and dirty implementation of the RSA algorithm in Python
- A multiband distortion plugin made in Rust with NIH-Plug
  - Here, I gained a great deal of understanding when it came to digital signal processing, and the ideas behind many of the plugins I use in my music.
  - Also helped a great deal with my sense of algorithms.
- A from-scratch implementation of neural networks in C++, and Racket.

# 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Math! A lot of it!

# 🏆 Achievements ...

# 😄 Outside of programming, I ...
- Make music under an alias: https://www.youtube.com/@sevenlivesmusic
- Do a slight bit of 3D modelling (I'm not good at it though).
